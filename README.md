ClosureTable
============

ClosureTable bundle allows you to easily store and manipulate hierarchical data. For example, categories of something or pages. The bundle is pretty simple, well-documented and easy to use. It has no configuration (except a few lines in the ClosureTable\ClosureTable model), so it's almost a plug-and-play thing. Remember though that you need to create database tables yourself by creating migrations.
