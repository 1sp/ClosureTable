# ClosureTable 2

Formerly bundle for Laravel 3, now it's a package for Laravel 4. It's intended to use when you need to operate hierarchical data in database. The package is a implementation of a well-known database design pattern called Closure Table. The codebase is being rewritten completely, however, the ClosureTable 2 is as simple in usage as ClosureTable 1 used to be from the start.
